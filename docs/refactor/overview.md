# Mondiale Game Refactoring Overview

## Project Overview

Mondiale is a game built to highlight similarities between countries through facts and statistics. The game uses a board-based system with challenges related to various country statistics.

## Core Areas for Refactoring

1. [State Management](./state-management.md)

   - Game store improvements
   - Socket event handling
   - Type safety enhancements

2. [Game Mechanics](./game-mechanics.md)

   - Challenge system
   - Game flow
   - Player progression

3. [Event System](./event-system.md)

   - Server events
   - Client events
   - Event validation

4. [Component Architecture](./component-architecture.md)

   - Board component
   - Game views
   - UI components

5. [Data Management](./data-management.md)

   - Country data
   - Challenge data
   - Game state

6. [Technical Infrastructure](./technical-infrastructure.md)
   - Build system
   - Testing setup
   - Performance monitoring

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority

   - Implement proper state management actions
